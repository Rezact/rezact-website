# Built in Router

No need to install an external dependency, Rezact comes with a built in router that is easy to use.

```typescript
import { useRouter } from "rezact/router";
import { Page as FourOhFour } from "./Pages/404";

const router = useRouter();

router.addRoute("/404", FourOhFour);

const routes = [
  {
    path: "/",
    component: () => import("src/Pages/LandingPage"),
    title: "Rezact",
  },
  {
    path: "/docs",
    component: () => import("src/Docs/PageOne.mdx"),
    title: "Rezact",
  },
  {
    path: "/users/:userId",
    component: () => import("src/Pages/Users"),
    title: "Rezact Users",
  },
];

router.addRoutesFromConfig(routes);

export { router };
```
