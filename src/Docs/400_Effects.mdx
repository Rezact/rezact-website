## Reactive Computations

Rezact allows you to derive values from reactive variables. These derived values are themselves reactive and will update whenever their dependencies change.

```jsx
let $count = 0;
let $doubled = $count * 2;

// ============================================

let $todos = [
  { $text: "Learn Rezact", $completed: false },
  { $text: "Build an app", $completed: true },
];

let $filter = "all";
let $filteredTodos = $todos.filter((todo) => {
  if ($filter === "all") return true;
  if ($filter === "completed") return todo.$completed;
  if ($filter === "todo") return !todo.$completed;
});
```

In the example above, $filteredTodos will automatically update whenever $todos changes.

## Reactive Statements

Rezact uses a concise and intuitive way to respond to changes in reactive data: reactive statements. These statements automatically execute whenever the data they depend on changes.

A reactive statement starts with the `$:` label, followed by the statement you want to execute:

```jsx
$: console.log(`the count is ${count}`);

$: {
  console.log(`the count is ${count}`);
  console.log(`this will also be logged whenever count changes`);
}

// ========================================
// hint: this is effectively a useEffect (react) or $effect (svelte 5)

let $dep1 = "someValue";
let $dep2 = "someValueAgain;";
$: {
  $dep1;
  $dep2;
  console.log("This effect runs whenever $dep1 or $dep2 change");
}

$dep1 = "new Dep Value triggers the effect above";
```

</div>
```
