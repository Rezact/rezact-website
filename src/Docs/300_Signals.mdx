# Signals (Reactive Variables)

Rezact offers a unique approach to reactivity, simplifying state management and component updates. This section will delve into the core principles of Rezact's reactivity system.

## 1. Reactive Variables

In Rezact, reactive variables are prefixed with a `$` sign. These variables are special because any changes to them will automatically trigger updates in the UI.

```jsx
let $count = 0;

let $todos = [
  { $text: "Learn Rezact", $completed: false },
  { $text: "Build an app", $completed: true },
];
```

Unlike traditional state management systems where state changes are explicitly triggered, in Rezact, simply modifying the value of a reactive variable is enough. Also notice that a reactive variable can be an array of objects with reactive properties as shown above.

## 2. Direct Data Mutation

One of the standout features of Rezact is its encouragement of direct data mutations. While many modern frameworks advocate for immutability, Rezact takes a different approach.

```jsx
// These will trigger a UI update

$count++;

$todos.push({ $text: "This is awesome!", $completed: false });
```

<hr class=" block p-8" />

# Simple Todo Tutorial

Let's demonstrate signals by building a todo example:

```jsx
let $todos: any = [
  { $text: "Learn Rezact", $completed: false },
  { $text: "Learn TypeScript", $completed: true },
  { $text: "Build something awesome", $completed: false },
];

export function Todo100() {
  return (
    <div class="m-4 rounded-lg bg-zinc-300 p-8 drop-shadow-xl">
      <h1>Todo List</h1>
      <p>{$todos.length} Todos</p>

      {$todos.map(($todo, $idx) => (
        <TodoItem $todo={$todo} $idx={$idx} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

function TodoItem({ $todo, $idx }) {
  const $completedStyle = $todo.$completed
    ? "text-decoration: line-through;"
    : "";

  return (
    <div style={$completedStyle} class="max-w-96">
      <span>
        {$idx + 1} - {$todo.$text}
      </span>

      <input type="checkbox" class="float-right" checked={$todo.$completed} />
    </div>
  );
}

```

### Output:

<Todo100 />

There are a couple subtle things happening in this example that need to be
broke down.

The very first thing you will notice is that the array of todo objects is
declared at the top of the module. In rezact, this is referred to as
**Module Level State.**

You could also declare the array inside the `Todo100` component as you
would when using `useState` in React. This would be called **Component Level State.**

More on all of that in a moment...

The last subtle thing in the example above is the following code from the
`TodoItem` component:

```jsx
const $completedStyle = $todo.$completed
  ? "text-decoration: line-through;"
  : "";
```

At first this seems pretty straightforward, but you may be wondering why we
bother creating a new signal to store the results. Those familiar with React
understand that entire component functions will rerun when state changes. In
contrast frameworks like SolidJS and Sveltes have component functions that will
only run **once** when first rendered. Rezact is the same way.

This is why assigning the results to a signal are important. There are 2 things
happening here.

- Rezact's compiler will detect any assignments to a signal that depend on other
  signals. In this case, the compiler instruments the instruction to track when
  `$todo.$completed` changes. When this happens the instrumented code will rerun
  the statement and assign the results to `$completedStyle`
- Rezact's runtime detects when signals are being used in the JSX and subscribes
  to changes so that it can update the DOM when the signal values update/change.
  In this case, when `$todo.$completed` is updated, so will `$completedStyle`.
  The runtime will handle updating the `style` attribute of the `span` element.

The rest of the example should feel pretty familiar for people experienced with
JSX frameworks.

Now back to state...

### Signals and State

In Rezact, `Signals` are just plain javascript objects. To be precise they are
instances of the Signal class. It is because of this, they can be declared
anywhere and passed around freely through function arguments or component props.

This turns out to be a very valuable and powerful feature as there are no
**hook rules** that must be observed (like when using `useState` in React).
This makes everything much simpler and reduces cognitive overhead.

The only thing that really needs to be kept in mind is that any variable or
object property that is prefixed with a `$` sign is a Signal in Rezact.
There are a few "Gotchas" that come with this and they are documented
are the [Gotchas](/docs/gotchas) section of the docs.

### Module Level State

Signals declared at the module level have a nice property in that they persist
across renders of any components declared inside the module. This works great
for Singletons where you want this behavior. To demonstrate this try changing
a couple items in the todo list and navigating to another page and coming back.
Keep in mind that if you refresh the page the module will be reloaded and state
will be lost. But navigating within the site using the sidebar or header will
maintain any state of items in the todo list because this is the nature of
**Single Page Applications.**

If you haven't guessed it already, this enables state stores without any extra
work... [Rezact Stores](/docs/stores) are simply Signals declared
and exported from a module.

### Component Level State

For components that are meant to be reused, it is best to declare signals inside
the component function as you would inside a regular react component. This
means the state will be created new everytime a component is mounted. This
behaves in all the ways that you would expect state declared in a component to
behave.

## Mutating Signals

Following our todo tutorial, how do we add new todos?

Below we show the code needed to add a new todo to the list.

```diff
+import { Btn } from "./Buttons";
+import { Form } from "./Form";
+import { Input } from "./ValidatorInput";
+import { $todos } from "./todoData";

export function Todo200() {
+  const addTodo = (data) => {
+    $todos.push({ $text: data.newTodo, $completed: false });
+  };

  return (
    <div class="m-4 rounded-lg bg-zinc-300 p-8 drop-shadow-xl">
      <h1>Todo List</h1>
      <p>{$todos.length} Todos</p>

      {$todos.map(($todo, $idx) => (
        <TodoItem $todo={$todo} $idx={$idx} />
      ))}

+      <Form onSubmit={addTodo}>
+        <Input placeholder="Add Todo" name="newTodo" required />
+        <Btn type="submit" class="mt-2 w-full">
+          Add
+        </Btn>
+      </Form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

<Todo200 />

Go ahead and try it out!

Wanna know the fun part??

The todo you just added here is available in the first todo list we created earlier!

Go ahead, scroll up, I dare you!

To be completely fair, we have pulled out the data and placed it in its own module ([store](/docs/stores)).
This is because we want to demonstrate how to use the data in multiple places.
But the point is that the data is available anywhere in the app and [Rezact stores](/docs/stores) make this easy.

And also to be even more fair, we are hiding some lower level details in the `Form`, `Btn` and `Input` components.
But the main focus is on the `addTodo` function. This is where the magic happens.

You can see all the source code in the repo for this website. All of it is completely approachable and easy to understand.

Probably the most important take away is that with rezact we don't need to make copies of data just so we can
satisfy a runtime comparison that would trigger a UI update. This is a huge win for performance and simplicity.

With Rezact, we can just mutate the data directly and the UI will update automatically.

## Deleting Todos

Ok, let's add a delete button.

```diff
function TodoItem({ $todo, $idx }) {
  const $completedStyle = $todo.$completed
    ? "text-decoration: line-through;"
    : "";

+  const deleteTodo = (todo) => {
+    $todos.deleteValue(todo);
+  };

  let $idxPlusOne = $idx + 1;

  return (
    <div style={$completedStyle} class="max-w-96 leading-7">
      <span>
        {$idxPlusOne} - {$todo.$text}
      </span>

+     <Btn onClick={() => deleteTodo($todo)}>X</Btn>

      <input type="checkbox" class="float-right" checked={$todo.$completed} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

<Todo300 />

Easy right? The `.deleteValue` method is a helper method that is available on all signals that are maps/arrays.
It's basically a wrapper around the native `splice` method. You could also do the following:

```jsx
const deleteTodo = (todo) => {
  const idx = $todos.indexOf(todo);
  $todos.splice(idx, 1);
};
```

## Filtering Todos

```diff
+function Radio({ label, id, checked }) {
+  return (
+    <div>
+      <input type="radio" id={id} value={id} checked={checked} />
+      <label for={id}>{label}</label>
+    </div>
+  );
+}

export function Todo400() {
  const addTodo = (data) => {
    $todos.push({ $text: data.newTodo, $completed: false });
  };

+ let $filter = "all";
+ let $filteredTodos = $todos.filter(($todo) => {
+   if ($filter === "all") return true;
+   if ($filter === "completed") return $todo.$completed;
+   if ($filter === "todo") return !$todo.$completed;
+ });

  return (
    <div class="m-4 rounded-lg bg-zinc-300 p-8 drop-shadow-xl">
      <h1>Todo List</h1>
      <p>{$todos.length} Todos</p>

+     <fieldset>
+       <legend>Filter:</legend>
+       <Radio label="Show All" id="all" checked={$filter} />
+       <Radio label="Show Completed" id="completed" checked={$filter} />
+       <Radio label="Show Todo" id="todo" checked={$filter} />
+     </fieldset>

-     {$todos.map(($todo, $idx) => (
+     {$filteredTodos.map(($todo, $idx) => (
        <TodoItem $todo={$todo} $idx={$idx} />
      ))}

      <Form onSubmit={addTodo}>
        <Input placeholder="Add Todo" name="newTodo" required />
        <Btn type="submit" class="mt-2 w-full">
          Add
        </Btn>
      </Form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

<Todo400 />

</div>
