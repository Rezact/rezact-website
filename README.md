## More Detail

Rezact is designed to react exactly as you want to your state changes with fine grained DOM updates and no virtual DOM or diffing.

Rezact is designed with the intention of combining the best of your favorite frameworks, with a particular focus on functional JSX components with a svelte style of state management: no useState hooks, simply declare variables and the compiler handles transforming them into reactive signals.

Rezact combines a minimal framework with a compiler to bring the best of both. The framework is very compatible with tree shaking and vite is great at bundling only the code that you use from the framework. This can make simple stateless components/applications bundles almost as small as writing pure HTML. The compiler reduces the amount of boilerplate you need to type in your functional components by transforming them like svelte does.
